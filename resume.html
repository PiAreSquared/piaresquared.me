                <h1>About Me</h1>
                <p class="about">I am a current senior attending Foothill High School. I am currently pursuing the 4-Year PLTW Engineering pathway, 
                    but also have a strong interest in computer science. I plan to major in computer science or aerospace engineering 
                    and hope to either work for tech startup in the Bay Area or start my own. 
                    Things that influenced my decision includes the many field trips and guest speakers
                     that my engineering classes showed me, such as the Manufactuing Day field trip, 
                     and the field trip to the Oakland airport. In my summer, I interned at Cisco Systems, 
                     where I developed tools to increase the efficiency of router configuration. 
                     I had a virtual internship at NASA and UT Austin's SEES program, and focused my research in the spread of COVID-19, 
                     and its analysis with data science.</p>
