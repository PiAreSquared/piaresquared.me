                        <p>Two developers and I created the Bay Area COVID-19 Tracker (BACT) â€” 
                            a real-time tracker for news, information, shortages, and health 
                            about the 2019 Novel Coronavirus Pandemic. BACT was featured 
                            in numerous news outlets and serves many users till this day.</p>
